</div>

<p class='c006'>[<em>Throws down pamphlets which he has been
reading. Excitedly combs his flowing spread of
whiskers with his fingers; pounds the table with
his fists; lets off brisk volleys of unsanctified language
at brief intervals, repentantly drooping
his head, between volleys, and kissing the Louis
XI crucifix hanging from his neck, accompanying
the kisses with mumbled apologies; presently
rises, flushed and perspiring, and walks the
floor, gesticulating</em>]</p>

<p class='c007'>—— ——!! —— ——!! If I had them by
the throat! [<em>Hastily kisses the crucifix, and
mumbles</em>] In these twenty years I have spent
millions to keep the press of the two hemispheres
quiet, and still these leaks keep on occurring.
I have spent other millions on religion
and art, and what do I get for it? Nothing.
Not a compliment. These generosities are
studiedly ignored, in print. In print I get nothing
but slanders—and slanders again—and still
slanders, and slanders on top of slanders! Grant
them true, what of it? They are slanders all the
same, when uttered against a king.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miscreants—they are telling <em>everything</em>!
Oh, everything: how I went pilgriming among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>the Powers in tears, with my mouth full of Bible
and my pelt oozing piety at every pore, and implored
them to place the vast and rich and populous
Congo Free State in trust in my hands as
their agent, so that I might root out slavery and
stop the slave raids, and lift up those twenty-five
millions of gentle and harmless blacks out of
darkness into light, the light of our blessed Redeemer,
the light that streams from his holy
Word, the light that makes glorious our noble
civilization—lift them up and dry their tears
and fill their bruised hearts with joy and gratitude—lift
them up and make them comprehend
that they were no longer outcasts and forsaken,
but our very brothers in Christ; how America
and thirteen great European states wept in sympathy
with me, and were persuaded; how their
representatives met in convention in Berlin and
made me Head Foreman and Superintendent of
the Congo State, and drafted out my powers and
limitations, carefully guarding the persons and
liberties and properties of the natives against
hurt and harm; forbidding whisky traffic and
gun traffic; providing courts of justice; making
commerce free and fetterless to the merchants
and traders of all nations, and welcoming and
safeguarding all missionaries of all creeds and
denominations. They have told how I planned
and prepared my establishment and selected my
horde of officials—“pals” and “pimps” of mine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“unspeakable Belgians” every one—and hoisted
my flag, and “took in” a President of the United
States, and got him to be the first to recognize it
and salute it. Oh, well, let them blackguard me
if they like; it is a deep satisfaction to me to
remember that I was a shade too smart for
that nation that thinks itself so
smart. Yes, I certainly did bunco
a Yankee—as those people
phrase it. Pirate flag?
Let them call it so—perhaps
it is. All the
same, <em>they were the
first to salute it</em>.</p>

<div  class='figright id002'>
<img src='images/i_007.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“They were the first to salute it”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These meddlesome
American missionaries!
these frank British
consuls! these blabbing
Belgian-born traitor officials!—those tiresome
parrots are always talking, always telling.
They have told how for twenty years I have
ruled the Congo State not as a trustee of the
Powers, an agent, a subordinate, a foreman,
but as a sovereign—sovereign over a
fruitful domain four times as large as the
German Empire—sovereign absolute, irresponsible,
above all law; trampling the
Berlin-made Congo charter under foot; barring
out all foreign traders but myself; restricting
commerce to myself, through concessionaires
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>who are my creatures and confederates;
seizing and holding the State as my personal
property, the whole of its vast revenues as my
private “swag”—mine, solely mine—claiming
and holding its millions of people as my private
property, my serfs, my slaves; their labor mine,
with or without wage; the food they raise not
their property but mine; the rubber, the ivory
and all the other riches of the land mine—mine
solely—and gathered for me by the men, the
women and the little children under compulsion
of lash and bullet, fire, starvation, mutilation and
the halter.</p>

<p class='c007'>These pests!—it is as I say, they have kept
back nothing! They have revealed these and
yet other details which shame should have kept
them silent about, since they were exposures of a
king, a sacred personage and immune from reproach,
by right of his selection and appointment
to his great office by God himself; a king
whose acts cannot be criticized without blasphemy,
since God has observed them from the
beginning and has manifested no dissatisfaction
with them, nor shown disapproval of them, nor
hampered nor interrupted them in any way. By
this sign I recognize his approval of what I have
done; his cordial and glad approval, I am sure
I may say. Blest, crowned, beatified with this
great reward, this golden reward, this unspeakably
precious reward, why should I care for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>men’s cursings and revilings of me? [<em>With a
sudden outburst of feeling</em>] May they roast a
million æons in—[<em>Catches his breath and effusively
kisses the crucifix; sorrowfully murmurs,
“I shall get myself damned yet, with these indiscretions
of speech.”</em>]</p>

<p class='c007'>Yes, they go on telling everything, these chatterers!
They tell how I levy incredibly burdensome
taxes upon the natives—taxes which are a
pure theft; taxes which they must satisfy by
gathering rubber under hard and constantly
harder conditions, and by raising and furnishing
food supplies gratis—and it all comes out that,
when they fall short of their tasks through hunger,
sickness, despair, and ceaseless and exhausting
labor without rest, and forsake their homes
and flee to the woods to escape punishment, my
black soldiers, drawn from unfriendly tribes,
and instigated and directed by my Belgians, hunt
them down and butcher them and burn their
villages—reserving some of the girls. They
tell it all: how I am wiping a nation of friendless
creatures out of existence by every form of
murder, for my private pocket’s sake, and how
every shilling I get costs a rape, a mutilation or
a life. But they never say, although they know
it, that I have labored in the cause of religion at
the same time and all the time, and have sent
missionaries there (of a “convenient stripe,” as
they phrase it), to teach them the error of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>ways and bring them to Him who is all mercy
and love, and who is the sleepless guardian and
friend of all who suffer. They tell only what is
against me, they will not tell what is in my
favor.</p>

<p class='c007'>They tell how England required of me a
Commission of Inquiry into Congo atrocities,
and how, to quiet that meddling country, with its
disagreeable Congo Reform Association, made
up of earls and bishops and John Morleys and
university grandees and other dudes, more interested
in other people’s business than in their own.
I appointed it. Did it stop their mouths? No,
they merely pointed out that it was a commission
composed wholly of my “Congo butchers,”
“the very men whose acts were to be inquired
into.” They said it was equivalent to appointing
a commission of wolves to inquire into depredations
committed upon a sheepfold. <em>Nothing</em>
can satisfy a cursed Englishman!<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. This visit had a more fortunate result than was anticipated.
One member of the Commission was a leading Congo official, another
an official of the government in Belgium, the third a Swiss
jurist. It was feared that the work of the Commission would not
be more genuine than that of innumerable so-called “investigations”
by local officials. But it appears that the Commission was
met by a very avalanche of awful testimony. One who was present
at a public hearing writes: “Men of stone would be moved by the
stories that are being unfolded as the Commission probes into the
awful history of rubber collection.” It is evident the commissioners
were moved. Of their report and its bearing upon the international
issue presented by the conceded conditions in the Congo
State, something is said on a supplementary page of this pamphlet.
Certain reforms were ordered by the Commission in the one section
visited, but the latest word is that after its departure conditions
were soon worse than before its coming.—M. T.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>And were the fault-finders frank with my private character? They could not be more so if
I were a plebeian, a peasant, a mechanic. They
remind the world that from the earliest days my
house has been chapel and brothel combined,
and both industries working full time; that I
practised cruelties upon my queen and my
daughters, and supplemented them with daily
shame and humiliations; that, when my queen
lay in the happy refuge of her coffin, and a
daughter implored me on her knees to let her
look for the last time upon her mother’s face, I
refused; and that, three years ago, not being
satisfied with the stolen spoils of a whole alien
nation, I robbed my own child of her property
and appeared by proxy in court, a spectacle to
the civilized world, to defend the act and complete
the crime. It is as I have said: they are unfair,
unjust; they will resurrect and give new
currency to such things as those, or to any other
things that count against me, but they will not
mention any act of mine that is in my favor. I
have spent more money on art than any other
monarch of my time, and they know it. Do
they speak of it, do they tell about it? No,
they do not. They prefer to work up what they
call “ghastly statistics” into offensive kindergarten
object lessons, whose purpose is to make sentimental
people shudder, and prejudice them
against me. They remark that “if the innocent
blood shed in the Congo State by King Leopold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>were put in buckets and the buckets placed side
by side, the line would stretch 2,000 miles; if
the skeletons of his ten millions of starved and
butchered dead could rise up and march in single
file, it would take them seven months and four
days to pass a given point; if compacted together
in a body, they would occupy more ground than
St. Louis covers, World’s Fair and all; if they
should all clap their bony hands at once, the
grisly crash would be heard at a distance of—”
Damnation, it makes me tired! And they do
similar miracles with the money I have distilled
from that blood and put into my pocket. They
pile it into Egyptian pyramids; they carpet Saharas
with it; they spread it across the sky, and
the shadow it casts makes twilight in the earth.
And the tears I have caused, the hearts I have
broken—oh, nothing can persuade them to let
<em>them</em> alone!</p>

<p class='c007'>[<em>Meditative pause</em>] Well&nbsp;... no matter, I
<em>did</em> beat the Yankees, anyway! there’s comfort in
that. [<em>Reads with mocking smile, the President’s
Order of Recognition of April 22, 1884</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'>“... the government of the United States announces
its sympathy with and approval of the humane and benevolent
purposes of (my Congo scheme), and will order the
officers of the United States, both on land and sea, to recognize
its flag as the flag of a friendly government.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Possibly the Yankees would like to take that
back, now, but they will find that my agents are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>not over there in America for nothing. But
there is no danger; neither nations nor governments
can afford to confess a blunder. [<em>With
a contented smile, begins to read from “Report
by Rev. W. M. Morrison, American missionary
in the Congo Free State”</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'>“I furnish herewith some of the many atrocious incidents
which have come under my own personal observation; they
reveal the <em>organized system</em> of plunder and outrage which has
been perpetrated and is now being carried on in that unfortunate
country by King Leopold of Belgium. I say King
Leopold, because he and he <em>alone</em> is now responsible, since
he is the <em>absolute sovereign</em>. <em>He styles himself such.</em> When
our government in 1884 laid the foundation of the Congo
Free State, by recognizing its flag, little did it know that this
concern, parading under the guise of philanthropy, was really
King Leopold of Belgium, one of the shrewdest, most heartless
and most conscienceless rulers that ever sat on a throne.
This is apart from his known corrupt morals, which have
made his name and his family a byword in two continents.
Our government would most certainly not have recognized
that flag had it known that it was really King Leopold individually
who was asking for recognition; had it known that
it was setting up in the heart of Africa an <em>absolute monarchy</em>;
had it known that, having put down African slavery in our
own country at great cost of blood and money, it was <em>establishing
a worse form of slavery right in Africa</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>[<em>With evil joy</em>] Yes, I certainly was a shade
too clever for the Yankees. It hurts; it gravels
them. They can’t get over it! Puts a shame
upon them in another way, too, and a graver
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>way; for they never can rid their records of the
reproachful fact that their vain Republic, self-appointed
Champion and Promoter of the Liberties
of the World, is the only democracy in history
that has lent its power and influence to the
establishing of an <em>absolute monarchy</em>!</p>

<p class='c007'>[<em>Contemplating, with an unfriendly eye, a
stately pile of pamphlets</em>] Blister the meddlesome
missionaries! They write tons of these
things. They seem to be always around, always
spying, always eye-witnessing
the happenings; and
everything they see they
commit to paper. They
are always prowling from
place to place; the natives
consider them their only
friends; they go to them
with their sorrows; they
show them their scars and
their wounds, inflicted by
my soldier police; they hold up the stumps of
their arms and lament because their hands have
been chopped off, as punishment for not bringing
in enough rubber, and as proof to be laid before
my officers that the required punishment
was well and truly carried out. One of these
missionaries saw eighty-one of these hands drying
over a fire for transmission to my officials—and
of course he must go and set it down and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>print it. They travel and travel, they spy and
spy! And nothing is too trivial for them to
print. [<em>Takes up a pamphlet. Reads a passage
from Report of a “Journey made in July, August
and September, 1903, by Rev. A. E. Scrivener,
a British missionary”</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'>“... Soon we began talking, and without any encouragement
on my part the natives began the tales I had
become so accustomed to. They were living in peace and
quietness when the white men came in from the lake with all
sorts of requests to do this and that, and they thought it
meant slavery. So they attempted to keep the white men
out of their country but without avail. The rifles were too
much for them. So they submitted and made up their minds
to do the best they could under the altered circumstances.
First came the command to build houses for the soldiers, and
this was done without a murmur. Then they had to feed
the soldiers and all the men and women—hangers on—who
accompanied them. Then they were told to bring in rubber.
This was quite a new thing for them to do. There was
rubber in the forest several days away from their home, but
that it was worth anything was news to them. A small
reward was offered and a rush was made for the rubber.
‘What strange white men, to give us cloth and beads for
the sap of a wild vine.’ They rejoiced in what they thought
their good fortune. But soon the reward was reduced until
at last they were told to bring in the rubber for nothing.
To this they tried to demur; but to their great surprise several
were shot by the soldiers, and the rest were told, with many
curses and blows, to go at once or more would be killed.
Terrified, they began to prepare their food for the fortnight’s
absence from the village which the collection of rubber entailed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>The soldiers discovered them sitting about. ‘What,
not gone yet?’ Bang! bang! bang! and down fell one and
another, dead, in the midst of wives and companions.
There is a terrible wail and an attempt made to prepare the
dead for burial, but this is not allowed. All must go at once
to the forest. Without food? Yes, without food. And
off the poor wretches had to go without even their tinder
boxes to make fires. Many died in the forests of hunger
and exposure, and still more from the rifles of the ferocious
soldiers in charge of the post. In spite of all their efforts the
amount fell off and more and more were killed. I was
shown around the place, and the sites of former big chiefs’
settlements were pointed out. A careful estimate made the
population of, say, seven years ago, to be 2,000 people in
and about the post, within a radius of, say, a quarter of a
mile. All told, they would not muster 200 now, and there
is so much sadness and gloom about them that they are fast
decreasing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We stayed there all day on Monday and had many talks
with the people. On the Sunday some of the boys had told
me of some bones which they had seen, so on the Monday
I asked to be shown these bones. Lying about on the grass,
within a few yards of the house I was occupying, were
numbers of human skulls, bones, in some cases complete
skeletons. I counted thirty-six skulls, and saw many sets of
bones from which the skulls were missing. I called one of
the men and asked the meaning of it. ‘When the rubber
palaver began,’ said he, ‘the soldiers shot so many we
grew tired of burying, and very often we were not
allowed to bury; and so just dragged the bodies out into the
grass and left them. There are hundreds all around if you
would like to see them.’ But I had seen more than enough,
and was sickened by the stories that came from men and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>women alike of
the awful time
they had passed through.
The Bulgarian atrocities
might be considered as
mildness itself when compared
with what was done here. How
the people submitted I don’t know,
and even now I wonder as I think of
their patience. That some of them
managed to run away is some cause
for thankfulness. I stayed there two days and the one
thing that impressed itself upon me was the collection of
rubber. I saw long files of men come in, as at Bongo, with
their little baskets under their arms; saw them paid their milk
tin full of salt, and the two yards of calico flung to the headmen;
saw their trembling timidity, and in fact a great deal
that all went to prove the state of terrorism that exists and
the virtual slavery in which the people are held.”</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>“Some bones which they had seen”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>That is their way; they spy and spy, and run
into print with every foolish trifle. And that
British consul, Mr. Casement, is just like them.
He gets hold of a <em>diary which had been kept by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>one of my government officers</em>, and, although it
is a private diary and intended for no eye but its
owner’s, Mr. Casement is so lacking in delicacy
and refinement as to print passages from it.
[<em>Reads a passage from the diary</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'>“Each time the corporal goes out to get rubber, cartridges
are given him. He must bring back all not used, and for every
one used he must bring back a right hand. M. P. told me
that sometimes they shot a cartridge at an animal in hunting;
they then cut off a hand from a living man. As to the
extent to which this is carried on, he informed me that in
six months the State on the Mambogo River had used 6,000
cartridges, which means that 6,000 people are killed or
mutilated. It means more than 6,000, for the people have
told me repeatedly that the soldiers kill the children with the
butt of their guns.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When the subtle consul thinks silence will be
more effective than words, he employs it. Here
he leaves it to be recognized that a thousand
killings and mutilations a month is a large output
for so small a region as the Mambogo River
concession, silently indicating the dimensions of
it by accompanying his report with a map of the
prodigious Congo State, in which there is not
room for so small an object as that river. That
silence is intended to say, “If it is a thousand a
month in this little corner, imagine the output of
the whole vast State!” A gentleman would not
descend to these furtivenesses.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Now as to the mutilations. You can’t head
off a Congo critic and make him stay headed-off;
he dodges, and straightway comes back at
you from another direction. They are full of
slippery arts. When the mutilations (severing
hands, unsexing men, etc.) began to stir Europe,
we hit upon the idea of excusing them with a
retort which we judged would knock them dizzy
on that subject for good and all, and leave them
nothing more to say; to wit, we boldly laid the
custom on the natives, and said we did not invent
it, but only followed it. Did it knock them
dizzy? did it shut their mouths? Not for an
hour. They dodged, and came straight back at
us with the remark that “if a Christian king can
perceive a saving moral difference between inventing
bloody barbarities, and <em>imitating them
from savages</em>, for charity’s sake let him get what
comfort he can out of his confession!”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is most amazing, the way that that consul
acts—that spy, that busy-body. [<em>Takes up
pamphlet “Treatment of Women and Children
in the Congo State; what Mr. Casement Saw
in 1903”</em>] <em>Hardly two years ago!</em> <em>Intruding</em>
that date upon the public was a piece of
cold malice. It was intended to weaken the
force of my press syndicate’s assurances to the
public that my severities in the Congo <em>ceased</em>,
and ceased utterly, <em>years and years ago</em>. This
man is fond of trifles—revels in them, gloats
over them, pets them, fondles them, sets them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>all down. One doesn’t need to drowse through
his monotonous report to see that; the mere subheadings
of its chapters prove it. [<em>Reads</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'>“Two hundred and forty persons, <em>men, women and children</em>,
compelled to supply government with <em>one ton</em> of carefully
prepared foodstuffs <em>per week</em>, receiving in remuneration, all
told, the princely sum of 15s. 10d!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Very well, it was liberal. It was not much
short of a penny a week for each nigger. It
suits this consul to belittle it, yet he knows very
well that I could have had both the food and the
labor for nothing. I can prove it by a thousand
instances. [<em>Reads</em>]</p>

<p class='c009'>“Expedition against a village behindhand in its (compulsory)
supplies; result, slaughter of sixteen persons; among
them three women and a boy of five years. Ten carried
off, to be prisoners till ransomed; among them a child, who
died during the march.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But he is careful not to explain that we are
<em>obliged</em> to resort to ransom to collect debts,
where the people have nothing to pay with.
Families that escape to the woods sell some of
their members into slavery and thus provide the
ransom. He knows that I would stop this if I
could find a less objectionable way to collect
their debts.... Mm—here is some more of
the consul’s delicacy! He reports a conversation
he had with some natives:</p>

<p class='c009'>Q. “How do you know it was the <em>white</em> men themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>who ordered these cruel things to be done to you?
These things must have been done without the white man’s
knowledge by the black soldiers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A. “The white men told their soldiers: ‘You only kill
<em>women</em>; you cannot kill men. You must prove that you
kill men.’ So then the soldiers when they killed us” (here
he stopped and hesitated and then pointing to&nbsp;... he said:)
“then they&nbsp;... and took them to the white men, who
said: ‘It is true, you have killed <em>men</em>.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Q. “You say this is true? Were many of you so treated
after being shot?”</p>

<p class='c009'>All [<em>shouting out</em>]: “<em>Nkoto! Nkoto!</em>” (“Very many!
Very many!”)</p>

<p class='c009'>“There was no doubt that these people were not inventing.
Their vehemence, their flashing eyes, their excitement, were
not simulated.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course the critic had to divulge that; he
has no self-respect. All his kind reproach me,
although they know quite well that I took no
pleasure in punishing the men in that particular
way, but only did it as a warning to other delinquents.
Ordinary punishments are no good with
ignorant savages; they make no impression.

of the Lord-Aberdeen-Norbury-John-Morley-Sir-Gilbert-Parker
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>stripe, will think they were all
killed. They were not. The great majority of
them escaped. They fled to the bush with their
families because of the rubber raids, and it was
there they died of hunger. Could we help that?</p>

Christian rulers tax their people, but furnish
schools, courts of law, roads, light, water and
protection to life and limb in return; King Leopold
taxes his stolen nation, but provides <em>nothing
in return but hunger, terror, grief, shame, captivity,
mutilation and massacre</em>.” That is their
style! I furnish “nothing”! I send the gospel
to the survivors; these censure-mongers know
it, but they would rather have their tongues cut
out than mention it. I have several times required
my raiders to give the dying an opportunity
to kiss the sacred emblem; and if they
obeyed me I have without doubt been the humble
means of saving many souls. None of my traducers
have had the fairness to mention this; but
let it pass; there is One who has not overlooked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>it, and that is my solace, that is my consolation.</p>

<p class='c007'>[<em>Puts down the Report, takes up a pamphlet,

<p class='c007'>This is where the “death-trap” comes in.
Meddlesome missionary spying around—Rev.
W. H. Sheppard. Talks with a black raider of
mine after a raid; cozens him into giving away
some particulars. The raider remarks:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘I demanded 30 slaves from this side of the stream and 30
from the other side; 2 points of ivory, 2,500 balls of rubber,
13 goats, 10 fowls and 6 dogs, some corn chumy, etc.’</p>

<p class='c009'>‘How did the fight come up?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘I sent for all their chiefs, sub-chiefs, men and women, to
come on a certain day, saying that I was going to finish all
the palaver. When they entered these small gates (the walls
being made of fences brought from other villages, the high
native ones) I demanded all my pay or I would kill them;
so they refused to pay me, and I ordered the fence to be
closed so they couldn’t run away; then we killed them here
inside the fence. The panels of the fence fell down and
some escaped.’</p>

<p class='c009'>‘How many did you kill?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘We killed plenty, will you see some of them?’</p>

<p class='c009'>That was just what I wanted.</p>

<p class='c009'>He said: ‘I think we have killed between eighty and ninety,
and those in the other villages I don’t know, I did not go
out but sent my people.’</p>

<p class='c009'>He and I walked out on the plain just near the camp.
There were three dead bodies with the flesh carved off from
the waist down.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Why are they carved so, only leaving the bones?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘My people ate them,’ he answered promptly. He then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>explained, ‘The men who have young children do not eat
people, but all the rest ate them.’ On the left was a big
man, shot in the back and without a head. (All these
corpses were nude.)</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Where is the man’s head?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Oh, they made a bowl of the forehead to rub up tobacco
and diamba in.’</p>

<p class='c009'>We continued to walk and examine until late in the afternoon,
and counted forty-one bodies. The rest had been
eaten up by the people.</p>

<p class='c009'>On returning to the camp, we crossed a young woman,
shot in the back of the head, one hand was cut away. I
asked why, and Mulunba N’Cusa explained that they always
cut off the right hand to give to the State on their return.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Can you not show me some of the hands?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>So he conducted us to a framework of sticks, under which
was burning a slow fire, and there they were, the right hands—I
counted them, eighty-one in all.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were not less than sixty women (Bena Pianga)
prisoners. I saw them.</p>

<p class='c009'>We all say that we have as fully as possible investigated

They report cases of it with a most offensive frequency.
My traducers do not forget to remark
that, inasmuch as I am absolute and with a
word can prevent in the Congo anything I
choose to prevent, then whatsoever is done there
by my permission is my act, my <em>personal</em> act;
that <em>I</em> do it; that the hand of my agent is as truly
my hand as if it were attached to my own arm;
and so they picture me in my robes of state, with
my crown on my head, munching human flesh,
saying grace, mumbling thanks to Him from
whom all good things come. Dear, dear, when
the soft-hearts get hold of a thing like that missionary’s
contribution they quite lose their tranquility
over it. They speak out profanely and
reproach Heaven for allowing such a fiend to
live. Meaning me. They think it irregular.
They go shuddering around, brooding over the
reduction of that Congo population from 25,000,000
to 15,000,000 in the twenty years of
my administration; then they burst out and call
me “the King with Ten Million Murders on his
Soul.” They call me a “record.” The most of
them do not stop with charging merely the 10,000,000
against me. No, they reflect that but
for me the population, by natural increase, would
now be 30,000,000, so they charge another 5,000,000
against me and make my total death-harvest
15,000,000. They remark that the man
who killed the goose that laid the golden egg was
responsible for the eggs she would subsequently
have laid if she had been let alone. Oh, yes,
they call me a “record.” They remark that
twice in a generation, in India, the Great Famine
destroys 2,000,000 out of a population of
320,000,000, and the whole world holds up its
hands in pity and horror; then they fall to wondering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>where the world would find room for its
emotions if I had a chance to trade places with
the Great Famine for twenty years! The idea
fires their fancy, and they go on and imagine the
Famine coming in state at the end of the twenty
years and prostrating itself before me, saying:
“Teach me, Lord, I perceive that I am but an
apprentice.” And next they imagine Death
coming, with his scythe and hour-glass, and begging
me to marry his daughter and reorganize
his plant and run the business. For the whole
world, you see! By this time their diseased
minds are under full steam, and they get down
their books and expand their labors, with me for
text. They hunt through all biography for my
match, working Attila, Torquemada, Ghengis
Khan, Ivan the Terrible, and the rest of that
crowd for all they are worth, and evilly exulting
when they cannot find it. Then they examine
the historical earthquakes and cyclones and blizzards
and cataclysms and volcanic eruptions:
verdict, none of them “in it” with me. At last
they do really hit it (as they think), and they
close their labors with conceding—reluctantly—that
I have <em>one</em> match in history, but only one—the
<em>Flood</em>. This is intemperate.</p>

<p class='c007'>But they are always that, when they think of
me. They can no more keep quiet when my
name is mentioned than can a glass of water control
its feelings with a seidlitz powder in its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>bowels. The bizarre things they can imagine,
with me for an inspiration! One Englishman
offers to give me the odds of three to one and bet
me anything I like, up to 20,000 guineas,
that for 2,000,000 years I am going to be the
most conspicuous foreigner in hell. The man
is so beside himself with anger that he does not
perceive that the idea is foolish. Foolish and
unbusinesslike: you see, there could be no winner;
both of us would be losers, on account of
the loss of interest on the stakes; at four or five
per cent. compounded, this would amount to—I
do not know how much, exactly, but, by the
time the term was up and the bet payable, a person
could buy hell itself with the accumulation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another madman wants to construct a memorial
for the perpetuation of my name, out of my
15,000,000 skulls and skeletons, and is full of
vindictive enthusiasm over his strange project.
He has it all ciphered out and drawn to scale.
Out of the skulls he will build a combined monument
and mausoleum to me which shall exactly
duplicate the Great Pyramid of Cheops, whose
base covers thirteen acres, and whose apex is
451 feet above ground. He desires to stuff me
and stand me up in the sky on that apex, robed
and crowned, with my “pirate flag” in one hand
and a butcher-knife and pendant handcuffs in the
other. He will build the pyramid in the centre
of a depopulated tract, a brooding solitude covered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>with weeds and the mouldering ruins of
burned villages, where the spirits of the starved
and murdered dead will voice their laments forever
in the whispers of the wandering winds.
Radiating from the pyramid, like the spokes of a
wheel, there are to be forty grand avenues of
approach, each thirty-five miles long, and each
fenced on both sides by skull-less skeletons standing
a yard and a half apart and festooned together
in line by short chains stretching from
wrist to wrist and attached to tried and true old
handcuffs stamped with my private trade-mark,
a crucifix and butcher-knife crossed, with motto,
“By this sign we prosper;” each osseous fence to
consist of 200,000 skeletons on a side, which is
400,000 to each avenue. It is remarked with
satisfaction that it aggregates three or four
thousand miles (single-ranked) of skeletons,—15,000,000
all told—and would stretch across
America from New York to San Francisco. It
is remarked further, in the hopeful tone of a
railroad company forecasting showy extensions
of its mileage, that my output is 500,000 corpses
a year when my plant is running full time, and
that therefore if I am spared ten years longer
there will be fresh skulls enough to add 175 feet
to the pyramid, making it by a long way the
loftiest architectural construction on the earth,
and fresh skeletons enough to continue the transcontinental
file (on piles) a thousand miles into
the Pacific. The cost of gathering the materials
from my “widely scattered and innumerable
private graveyards,” and transporting them, and
building the monument and the radiating grand
avenues, is duly ciphered out, running into an
aggregate of millions of guineas, and then—why
then, (—— ——!! —— ——!!) this idiot
asks me to <em>furnish the money!</em> [<em>Sudden and effusive
application of the crucifix</em>] He reminds
me that my yearly income from the Congo is
millions of guineas, and that “<em>only</em>” 5,000,000
would be required for his enterprise. Every day
wild attempts are made upon my purse; they do
not affect me, they cost me not a thought. But
<em>this one</em>—this one troubles me, makes me nervous;
for there is no telling what an unhinged
creature like this may think of next.... <em>If

<p class='c007'>[<em>Studies some photographs of

been a sore calamity to us. The
most powerful enemy that has
confronted us, indeed. In the early years
we had no trouble in getting the press to
“expose” the tales of the mutilations as
slanders, lies, inventions of busy-body American
missionaries and exasperated foreigners who had
found the “open door” of the Berlin-Congo
charter closed against them when they innocently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>went out there to trade; and by the press’s
help we got the Christian nations everywhere to
turn an irritated and unbelieving ear to those
tales and say hard things about the tellers of
them. Yes, all things went harmoniously and
pleasantly in those good days, and I was looked
up to as the benefactor of a down-trodden and
friendless people. Then all of a sudden came
the crash! That is to say, the incorruptible
<em>kodak</em>—and all the harmony went to hell! The
only witness I have encountered in my long experience
that I couldn’t bribe. Every Yankee
missionary and every interrupted trader sent
home and got one; and now—oh, well, the pictures
get sneaked around everywhere, in spite of
all we can do to ferret them out and suppress
them. Ten thousand pulpits and ten thousand
presses are saying the good word for me all the
time and placidly and convincingly denying the
mutilations. Then that trivial little kodak, that

</div>

<p class='c006'>Since the first edition of this pamphlet was issued, the
Congo story has entered upon a new chapter. The king’s
Commission concedes the correctness of the delineation contained
in the foregoing pages. It affirms the prevalence of
frightful abuses under the king’s rule. For eight months the
king held back the Report but his commissioners had been too
deeply moved by the horrors unfolded before them in their
visit to the Congo State and the testimony presented to them
had reached the world through other sources. The digest of
the report, as forwarded from Brussels to the European and
American press, was skilfully edited; and the report itself
does its best to gloss over the king’s responsibility for the
shame; but the story told in the genuine document is essentially
as hideous as anything found in the depositions of
plain-speaking missionaries. So the facts are clear,—indisputable,
undisputed. The train of revilers of missionary testimony,
whose roseate pictures of conditions under the king’s
rule have beguiled the uninformed, hurries out at the wings
and Leopold is left to hold the stage, with the skeleton that
refuses longer to stay hidden in his Congo closet.</p>

<p class='c007'>One thing the report omits to do. It does not brand or
judge the system out of which the foul breed of iniquities has
sprung,—the king’s claim to personal ownership of 800,000
square miles of territory, with all their products, and his
employment of savage hordes to realize on his claim.
Judgment of this policy the Commission holds to be beyond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>its function. Being thus disqualified for striking at the roots
of the enormity, the commissioners propose such superficial
reforms as occur to them. And the king hastens to take up
with their suggestion by calling to his assistance in the work
of reform a new Commission. Of this body of fourteen
members all but two are committed by their past record to
defense and maintenance of the king’s Congo policy.</p>

<p class='c007'>So ends the king’s investigation of himself; doubtless less
jubilantly than he had planned, but withal as ineffectively as
it was foredoomed to end. One stage is achieved. The
next in order is action by the Powers responsible for the existence
of the Congo State. The United States is one of
these. Such procedure is advocated in petitions to the
President and Congress, signed by John Wanamaker, Lyman
Abbott, Henry Van Dyke, David Starr Jordan and many
other leading citizens. If ever the sisterhood of civilized
nations have just occasion to go up to the Hague or some
other accessible meeting place, a foreordained hour for their
assembling has now struck.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Apart from the rough plantations which barely suffice
to feed the natives themselves and to supply the stations, all
the fruits of the soil are considered as the property of the
State or of the concessionaire societies.... It has even
been admitted that on the land occupied by them the
natives cannot dispose of the produce of the soil except to
the extent in which they did so before the constitution
of the State.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Each official in charge of a Station, or agent in charge
of a factory, claimed from the natives, without asking himself
on what grounds, the most divers imposts in labor or in
kind, either to satisfy his own needs and those of his Station,
or to exploit the riches of the Domaine.... The agents
themselves regulated the tax and saw to its collection and had
a direct interest in increasing its amount, since they received
proportional bonuses on the produce thus collected.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Missionaries, both Catholic and Protestant, whom we
heard at Leopoldville, were unanimous in accentuating the
general wretchedness existing in the region. One of them
said that “this system which compels the natives to feed
3000 workmen at Leopoldville, will, if continued for
another five years, wipe out the population of the district.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Judicial officials have informed us of the sorry consequences
of the porterage system; it exhausts the unfortunate
people subjected to it, and threatens them with partial
destruction.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the majority of cases the native must go one or two
days’ march every fortnight, until he arrives at that part of
the forest where the rubber vines can be met with in a
certain degree of abundance. There the collector passes a number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>of days in a miserable existence. He has to build himself
an improvised shelter which cannot, obviously, replace his
hut. He has not the food to which he is accustomed. He
is deprived of his wife, exposed to the inclemencies of the
weather and the attacks of wild beasts. When once he has
collected the rubber he must bring it to the State station, or
to that of the Company, and only then can he return to his
village where he can sojourn for barely more than two or
three days because the next demand is upon him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was barely denied that in the various posts of the
A. B. I. R. which we visited, the imprisonment of women
hostages, the subjection of the chiefs to servile labor, the
humiliations meted out to them, the flogging of rubber
collectors, the brutality of the black employees set over the
prisoners, were the rule commonly followed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“According to the witnesses, these auxiliaries, especially
those stationed in the villages, convert themselves into despots,
claiming the women and the food; they kill without pity all
those who attempt to resist their whims. The truth of the
charges is borne out by a mass of evidence and official
reports.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The consequences are often very murderous. And one
must not be astonished. If in the course of these delicate
operations, whose object it is to seize hostages and to intimidate
the natives, constant watch cannot be exercised over the
sanguinary instincts of the soldiers, when orders to punish
are given by superior authority, it is difficult to prevent the
expedition from degenerating into massacres, accompanied by
pillage and incendiarism.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND THE CONGO STATE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The International Association of the Congo was recognized
by the United States April 22, 1884. Nine months
afterward, recognition was secured from Germany and, later,
successively from the other European Powers. Two international
conferences were held at which the Powers constituted
themselves guardians of the people of the Congo territory,
the Association binding itself to regard the principles of
administration adopted. In both these conferences the United
States government prominently participated. The Act of Berlin
was not submitted by the President of the United States for ratification
by the Senate because its adoption as a whole was
thought by him to involve responsibility for support of the
territorial claims of rival Powers in the Congo region.
The Act of Brussels, with a proviso safeguarding this point,
was formally ratified by the United States. Whether we
are without obligation to reach a hand to this expiring
people, the intelligent reader will judge for himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stanley saw neither fortress nor flag of any civilization
save that of the United States, which he carried along the
arterial water course.... The first appeal for recognition
and for moral support was naturally and justly made to the
government whose flag was first carried across the region.”—<cite>Mr.
Kasson in North American Review, February, 1886.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>“This Government at the outset testified its lively interest
in the well-being and future progress of the vast region now
committed to your Majesty’s wise care, by being the first
among the Powers to recognize the flag of the International
Association of the Congo as that of a friendly State.”—<cite>President
Cleveland to King Leopold, September 11, 1885.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>“The recognition by the United States was the birth into
new life of the Association, seriously menaced as its existence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>was by opposing interests and ambitions.”—<cite>Mr. Stanley,
“The Congo,” vol. 1, page 383.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>“He (the President of the United States) desires to see
in the delimitation of the region which shall be subjected to
this beneficent rule (of the International Association of the
Congo) the widest expansion consistent with the just territorial
rights of other governments.”—<cite>Address of Mr. Kasson,
U. S. Representative at Berlin Conference, 1884.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>“So marked was the acceptance by the Berlin Conference
of the views presented on the part of the United States that
Herr Von Bunsen, reviewing the action of the Conference,
assigns after Germany the first place of influence in
the Conference to the United States.—<cite>Mr. Kasson in
North American Review, February, 1886.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>“In sending a representative to this Assembly, the Government
of the U. S. has wished to show the great interest
and deep sympathy it feels in the great work of philanthropy
which the Conference seeks to realize. Our country must
feel beyond all others an immense interest in the work of this
Assembly.”—<cite>Mr. Terrell, U. S. Representative at
Brussels Conference, 1st session, November 19, 1889.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Terrell informs the Conference that he has been
authorized by his Government to sign the General Act
adopted by the Conference.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The President says that the U. S. Minister’s communication
will be received by the Conference with extreme satisfaction.”—<cite>Records
of Brussels Conference, June 28, 1890.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>“Claiming, as at Berlin, to speak in the name of
Almighty God, the signatories (at Brussels) declared themselves
to be ‘equally animated by the firm intention of putting
an end to the crimes and devastations engendered by the
traffic in African slaves, of protecting effectually the aboriginal
populations and of ensuring the benefits of peace and civilization.’”—<cite>“Civilization
in Congo land,” H. R. Fox Bourne.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>“The President continues to hope that the Government
of the U. S., which was the first to recognize the Congo
Free State, will not be one of the last to give it the assistance
of which it may stand in need.”—<cite>Remarks of Belgian
President of Brussels Conference, session May 14, 1890.</cite></p>

<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><span class='xsmall'>INTERVIEW BY MR. W. T. STEAD WITH THE REV. JOHN H. HARRIS, BARINGA, CONGO STATE, IN THE ENGLISH REVIEW OF REVIEWS FOR SEPTEMBER, 1905.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>For the somewhat startling suggestion in the heading of
this interview, the missionary interviewed is in no way
responsible. The credit of it, or, if you like, the discredit,
belongs entirely to the editor of the <cite>Review</cite>, who, without
dogmatism, wishes to pose the question as a matter for serious
discussion. Since Charles I’s head was cut off, opposite
Whitehall, nearly two hundred and fifty years ago, the sanctity
which doth hedge about a king has been held in slight
and scant regard by the Puritans and their descendants.
Hence there is nothing antecedently shocking or outrageous
in the discussion of the question whether the acts of any
Sovereign are such as to justify the calling in of the services
of the public executioner. It is not, of course, for a journalist
to pronounce judgment, but no function of the public
writer is so imperative as that of calling attention to great
wrongs, and no duty is more imperious than that of insisting
that no rank or station should be allowed to shield from
justice the real criminal when he is once discovered.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. The above article which came to hand as the foregoing was in press
is commended to the king and to readers of his Soliloquy.—M. T.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The controversy between the Congo Reform Association
and the Emperor of the Congo has now arrived at a stage in
which it is necessary to take a further step towards the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>redress of unspeakable wrongs and the punishment of no less
unspeakable criminals. The Rev. J. H. Harris, an English
missionary, has lived for the last seven years in that region
of Central Africa—the Upper Congo—which King Leopold
has made over to one of his vampire groups of financial
associates (known as the A.B.I.R. Society) on the strictly
business basis of a half share in the profits wrung from the
blood and misery of the natives. He has now returned to
England, and last month he called at Mowbray House to
tell me the latest from the Congo. Mr. Harris is a young
man in a dangerous state of volcanic fury, and no wonder.
After living for seven years face to face with the devastations
of the vampire State, it is impossible to deny that he does
well to be angry. When he began, as is the wont of those
who have emerged from the depths, to detail horrifying
stories of murder, the outrage and torture of women, the
mutilation of children, and the whole infernal category of
horrors, served up with the background of cannibalism,
sometimes voluntary and sometimes, incredible though it
seems, enforced by the orders of the officers, I cut him short,
and said:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear Mr. Harris, as in Oriental despatches the India
Office translator abbreviates the first page of the letter into
two words ‘after compliments,’ or ‘a.c.,’ so let us abbreviate
our conversation about the Congo by the two words
‘after atrocities,’ or ‘a.a.’ They are so invariable and so
monotonous, as Lord Percy remarked in the House the other
day, that it is unnecessary to insist upon them. There is no
longer any dispute in the mind of any reasonable person as to
what is going on in the Congo. It is the economical
exploitation of half a continent carried on by the use of
armed force wielded by officials the aim-all and be-all
of whose existence is to extort the maximum amount of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>rubber in the shortest possible time in order to pay the
largest possible dividend to the holders of shares in the concessions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said Mr. Harris reluctantly, for he is so accustomed
to speaking to persons who require to be told the
whole dismal tale from A to Z, “what is it you want to
know?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want to know,” I said, “whether you consider the
time is ripe for summoning King Leopold before the bar of
an international tribunal to answer for the crimes perpetrated
under his orders and in his interest in the Congo State.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Harris paused for a moment, and then said:—“That
depends upon the action which the king takes upon
the report of the Commission, which is now in his hands.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is that report published?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” said Mr. Harris; “and it is a question whether
it will ever be published. Greatly to our surprise, the
Commission, which every one expected would be a mere
blind whose appointment was intended to throw dust in the
eyes of the public, turned out to be composed of highly respectable
persons who heard the evidence most impartially,
refused no <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</span></i> testimony produced by trustworthy witnesses,
and were overwhelmed by the multitudinous horrors
brought before them, and who, we feel, <em>must</em> have arrived
at conclusions which necessitate an entire revolution in the
administration of the Congo.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you quite sure, Mr. Harris,” I said, “that this is
so?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said Mr. Harris, “quite sure. The Commission
impressed us all in the Congo very favorably. Some of
its members seemed to us admirable specimens of public-spirited,
independent statesmen. They realized that they
were acting in a judicial capacity; they knew that the eyes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>of Europe were upon them, and, instead of making their inquiry
a farce, they made it a reality, and their conclusions
must be, I feel sure, so damning to the State, that if King
Leopold were to take no action but to allow the whole
infernal business to proceed unchecked, any international tribunal
which had powers of a criminal court, would upon the
evidence of the Commission alone, send those responsible to
the gallows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Unfortunately,” I said, “at present the Hague Tribunal
is not armed with the powers of an international assize
court, nor is it qualified to place offenders, crowned or otherwise,
in the dock. But don’t you think that in the evolution
of society the constitution of such a criminal court is a
necessity?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would be a great convenience at present,” said Mr.
Harris; “nor would you need one atom of evidence beyond
the report of the Commission to justify the hanging
of whoever is responsible for the existence and continuance
of such abominations.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Has anybody seen the text of the report?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As the Commission returned to Brussels in March, some
of the contents of that report are an open secret. A great
deal of the evidence has been published by the Congo Reform
Association. In the Congo the Commissioners admitted
two things: first, that the evidence was overwhelming as to
the existence of the evils which had hitherto been denied, and
secondly, that they vindicated the character of the missionaries.
They discovered, as anyone will who goes out to that
country, that it is the missionaries, and the missionaries alone,
who constitute the permanent European element. The
Congo State officials come out ignorant of the language,
knowing nothing of the country, and with no other sense of
their duties beyond that of supporting the concession companies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>in extorting rubber. They are like men who are
dumb and deaf and blind, nor do they wish to be otherwise.
In two or three years they vanish, giving place to other
migrants as ignorant as themselves, whereas the missionaries
remain on the spot year after year; they are in personal
touch with the people, whose language they speak, whose
customs they respect, and whose lives they endeavor to
defend to the best of their ability.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Mr. Harris,” I remarked, “was there not a certain
Mr. Grenfell, a Baptist Missionary, who has been all
these years a convinced upholder of the Congo State?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“’Twas true,” said Mr. Harris, “and pity ’tis ’twas
true; but ’tis no longer true. Mr. Grenfell has had his eyes
opened at last, and he has now taken his place among those
who are convinced. He could no longer resist the overwhelming
evidence that has been brought against the Congo
Administration.”<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c008'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. Mr. Grenfell’s station is in the Lower Congo, a section remote
from the vast rubber areas of the interior.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Was the nature of the Commissioners’ report,” I resumed,
“made known to the officials of the State before
they left the Congo?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To the head officials—yes,” said Mr. Harris.</p>

<p class='c007'>“With what result?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the case of the highest official in the Congo, the man
who corresponds in Africa to Lord Curzon in India, no
sooner was he placed in possession of the conclusions of the
Commission than the appalling significance of their indictment
convinced him that the game was up, and he went into
his room and cut his throat. I was amazed on returning to
Europe to find how little the significance of this suicide was
appreciated. A paragraph in the newspaper announced the
suicide of a Congo official. None of those who read that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>paragraph could realize the fact that that suicide had the same
significance to the Congo that the suicide, let us say, of
Lord Milner would have had if it had taken place immediately
on receiving the conclusions of a Royal Commission
sent out to report upon his administration in South Africa.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, if that be so, Mr. Harris,” I said, “and the
Governor-General cuts his throat rather than face the ordeal
and disgrace of the exposure, I am almost beginning to hope
that we may see King Leopold in the dock at the Hague,
after all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will comment upon that,” Mr. Harris said, “by
quoting you Mrs. Sheldon’s remark made before myself and
my colleagues, Messrs. Bond, Ellery, Ruskin, Walbaum and
Whiteside, on May 19th last year, when, in answer to our
question, ‘Why should King Leopold be afraid of submitting
his case to the Hague tribunal?’ Mrs. Sheldon answered,
‘Men do not go to the gallows and put their heads in a noose
if they can avoid it.’”</p>
